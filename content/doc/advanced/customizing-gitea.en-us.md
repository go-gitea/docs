# Customizing Gitea

The main way to customize Gitea is by using the `custom` folder. This is the central place to override and configure features.

## Customizing /robots.txt

To make Gitea serve your own `/robots.txt` (by default, an empty 404 status is served), simply create a file called `robots.txt` in the `custom` folder with the [expected contents](http://www.robotstxt.org/). **Note** that you have to restart Gitea for it to notice the new `robots.txt`.
