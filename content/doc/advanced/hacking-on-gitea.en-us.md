# Hacking on Gitea

We won't cover the basics of a Golang setup within this guide. If you don't know how to get the environment up and running you should follow the official [install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install).

If you want to contribute to Gitea you should fork the project and work on the `master` branch. There is a catch though, some internal packages are referenced by their GitHub URL. So you have to trick the Go tool to think that you work on a clone of the official repository. Start by downloading the source code as you normally would:

```
go get -d code.gitea.io/gitea
```

Now it's time to fork the [Gitea repository](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea) on GitHub, after that you should have to switch to the source directory on the command line:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/code.gitea.io/gitea
```

To be able to create pull requests you should add your forked repository as a remote to the Gitea sources, otherwise you can not apply the changes to our repository because of lacking write permissions:

```
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin git@github.com:<USERNAME>/gitea.git
git fetch --all --prune
```

You've got a working development environment for Gitea now. Take a look at the `Makefile` to get an overview about the available tasks. The most common tasks should be `make test` which will start our test environment and `make build` which will build a `gitea` binary into your working directory. Writing test cases is not mandatory to contribute, but we will be happy if you do.

Thatâ€™s it! You are ready to hack on Gitea. Test your changes, push them to your repository and open a pull request.
