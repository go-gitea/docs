# Authentication

## LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)

Both the LDAP via BindDN and the simple auth LDAP share the following fields:

- Authorization Name **(required)**
  - A name to assign to the new method of authorization.

- Host **(required)**
  - The address where the LDAP server can be reached.
  - Example: `mydomain.com`

- Port **(required)**
  - The port to use when connecting to the server.
  - Example: `389` for LDAP or `636` for LDAP SSL

- Enable TLS Encryption (optional)
  - Whether to use TLS when connecting to the LDAP server.

- Admin Filter (optional)
  - An LDAP filter specifying if a user should be given administrator
    privileges. If a user account passes the filter, the user will be
    privileged as an administrator.
  - Example: `(objectClass=adminAccount)`
  - Example for Microsoft Active Directory (AD): `(memberOf=CN=admin-group,OU=example,DC=example,DC=org)`

- Username attribute (optional)
  - The attribute of the user's LDAP record containing the user name. Given
    attribute value will be used for new Gitea account user name after first
    successful sign-in. Leave empty to use login name given on sign-in form.
  - This is useful when supplied login name is matched against multiple
    attributes, but only single specific attribute should be used for Gitea
    account name, see "User Filter".
  - Example: `uid`
  - Example for Microsoft Active Directory (AD): `sAMAccountName`

- First name attribute (optional)
  - The attribute of the user's LDAP record containing the user's first name.
    This will be used to populate their account information.
  - Example: `givenName`

- Surname attribute (optional)
  - The attribute of the user's LDAP record containing the user's surname.
    This will be used to populate their account information.
  - Example: `sn`

- E-mail attribute **(required)**
  - The attribute of the user's LDAP record containing the user's email
    address. This will be used to populate their account information.
  - Example: `mail`

**LDAP via BindDN** adds the following fields:

- Bind DN (optional)
  - The DN to bind to the LDAP server with when searching for the user. This
    may be left blank to perform an anonymous search.
  - Example: `cn=Search,dc=mydomain,dc=com`

- Bind Password (optional)
  - The password for the Bind DN specified above, if any. _Note: The password
    is stored in plaintext at the server. As such, ensure that your Bind DN
    has as few privileges as possible._

- User Search Base **(required)**
  - The LDAP base at which user accounts will be searched for.
  - Example: `ou=Users,dc=mydomain,dc=com`

- User Filter **(required)**
  - An LDAP filter declaring how to find the user record that is attempting to
    authenticate. The `%s` matching parameter will be substituted with login
    name given on sign-in form.
  - Example: `(&(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=%s))`
  - Example for Microsoft Active Directory (AD): `(&(objectCategory=Person)(memberOf=CN=user-group,OU=example,DC=example,DC=org)(sAMAccountName=%s)(!(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2)))`
  - To substitute more than once `%[1]s` should be used instead, e.g. when
    matching supplied login name against multiple attributes such as user
    identifier, email or even phone number.
  - Example: `(&(objectClass=Person)(|(uid=%[1]s)(mail=%[1]s)(mobile=%[1]s)))`
- Enable user synchronization
  - This option enables a periodic task that keeps the Gitea users synchronized
    with the LDAP server. The default period is every 24 hours but that can be
    changed in the
    [app.ini](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/master/conf/app.ini) file
    (see cron.sync_external_users section).  The _User Search Base_ and _User
    Filter_ settings described above will limit which users can use Gitea, and
    also which users will be synchronized.  When initially run the task will
    create all LDAP users that match the given settings so take care if working
    with large Enterprise LDAP directories.

**LDAP using simple auth** adds the following fields:

- User DN **(required)**
  - A template to use as the user's DN. The `%s` matching parameter will be substituted with login name given on sign-in form.
  - Example: `cn=%s,ou=Users,dc=mydomain,dc=com`
  - Example: `uid=%s,ou=Users,dc=mydomain,dc=com`

- User Filter **(required)**
  - An LDAP filter declaring when a user should be allowed to log in. The `%s`
    matching parameter will be substituted with login name given on sign-in
    form.
  - Example: `(&(objectClass=posixAccount)(cn=%s))`
  - Example: `(&(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=%s))`

**Verify group membership in LDAP** uses the following fields:

* Group Search Base (optional)
    * The LDAP DN used for groups.
    * Example: `ou=group,dc=mydomain,dc=com`

* Group Name Filter (optional)
    * An LDAP filter declaring how to find valid groups in the above DN.
    * Example: `(|(cn=gitea_users)(cn=admins))`

* User Attribute in Group (optional)
    * Which user LDAP attribute is listed in the group.
    * Example: `uid`

* Group Attribute for User (optional)
    * Which group LDAP attribute contains an array above user attribute names.
    * Example: `memberUid`

## PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module)

To configure this you just need to set the 'PAM Service Name' to a filename in `/etc/pam.d/`.
If you want it to work with normal Linux passwords, the user running Gitea must have read access to `/etc/shadow`.

## SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

This option allows Gitea to log in to your SMTP host as a Gitea user. To configure this, simply set the fields below:

- Authentication Name **(required)**
  - A name to assign to the new method of authorization.

- SMTP Authentication Type **(required)**
  - Type of authentication for use on your SMTP host, PLAIN or LOGIN.

- Host **(required)**
  - The address where the SMTP host can be reached.
  - Example: `smtp.mydomain.com`

- Port **(required)**
  - The port to use when connecting to the server.
  - Example: `587`

- Allowed Domains
  - Restrict what domains can log in if you're using public SMTP host or SMTP host with multiple domains.
  - Example: `gitea.io,mydomain.com,mydomain2.com`

- Enable TLS Encryption
  - Enable TLS encryption on authentication.

- Skip TLS Verify
  - Disable TLS verify on authentication.
  
- This authentication is activate
  - Enable or disable this auth.

## FreeIPA

- In order to log in to Gitea using FreeIPA credentials, you need to create a bind account for Gitea to use:

-  On the FreeIPA server, create a `gitea.ldif` file, replacing `dc=example,dc=com` with your DN, and providing an appropriately secure password:
```
  dn: uid=gitea,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=example,dc=com
  changetype: add
  objectclass: account
  objectclass: simplesecurityobject
  uid: gitea
  userPassword: secure password
  passwordExpirationTime: 20380119031407Z
  nsIdleTimeout: 0
```

- Import the LDIF (change localhost to an IPA server if needed), youâ€™ll be prompted for your Directory Manager password:
```
  ldapmodify -h localhost -p 389 -x -D \
  "cn=Directory Manager" -W -f gitea.ldif
```
-  Add an IPA group for gitea_users :
```
  ipa group-add --desc="Gitea Users" gitea_users
```
-  Note: If you get an error about IPA credentials, please run `kinit admin` and give your admin account password.

-  Now login to the Gitea as an Administrator, click on "Authentication" under Admin Panel. Then click `Add New Source` and fill in the details, changing all where appropriate to your own domain.
