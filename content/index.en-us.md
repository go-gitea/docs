# What is Gitea?

Gitea is a painless self-hosted Git service. You can compare it with GitHub, Bitbucket or Gitlab. The initial development have been done on [Gogs](http://gogs.io) but we have forked it and named it Gitea. If you want to read more about the reasons why we have done that please read [this](https://blog.gitea.io/welcome-to-gitea/) blog post.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service. With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across ALL platforms that Go supports, including Linux, macOS and Windows, even on architectures like ARM or PowerPC.
