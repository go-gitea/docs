# What is Gitea?

Gitea is a painless self-hosted Git service. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket or Gitlab. The initial development have been done on [Gogs](http://gogs.io) but we have forked it and named it Gitea. If you want to read more about the reasons why we have done that please read [this](https://blog.gitea.io/2016/12/welcome-to-gitea/) blog post.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service. With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across ALL platforms that Go supports, including Linux, macOS and Windows, even on architectures like ARM or PowerPC.

## System Requirements

- A cheap Raspberry Pi is powerful enough for basic functionality.
- 2 CPU cores and 1GB RAM would be the baseline for teamwork.
- Gitea is supposed to be run with a dedicated non-root user account on UNIX systems, no other mode of operation is supported. (**NOTE**: in case you run it with your own user account and the built-in SSH server disabled, Gitea modifies the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file so you will **not** be able to interactively log in.)

## Browser Support

- Please see [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI#browser-support) for specific versions of supported browsers.
- The official support minimal size  is **1024*768**, UI may still looks right in smaller size but no promises and fixes.
