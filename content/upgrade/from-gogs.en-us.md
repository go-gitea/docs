# Upgrade from gogs

If you are running Gogs which version is below 0.9.99, you can upgrade Gogs to Gitea smoothly.
There are some steps to do below:

* Stop Gogs
* Copy Gogs `custom/conf/app.ini` to Gitea. If you have changed the templates, you have to merge them to Gitea's templates manually.
* Run Gitea
* Enter Gitea admin panel on the UI, run `Rewrite '.ssh/authorized_keys' file (caution: non-Gitea keys will be lost)`
   and `Rewrite all update hook of repositories (needed when custom config path is changed)`.

## TBD
